art is a feeble attempt to express the unexpressable
# and I am trying to artisticly express my takes on the unexpressable


Needless to say, expect variance in the quality of my reviews. My goal with
this blog will change and grow as I do, and I hope to document that. Someday it
may have decent structure, but my thoughts are often scattered, intermetent,
and filled with pointless superletives and uneccesary adjectives. I think I 
get my ideas across better in person- at the very least my hands and eyes
scare the person I'm speaking with into pretending they understand. Here I
will learn to translate hand waiving into inteligible text.
