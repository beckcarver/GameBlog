title: Elden Ring and the Nintendo approach

# lol

Unrelenting refinement, and conservative change seem to be a common thread between
FromSoftware and Nintendo. Nintendo has been chasing after the same feelings of
exploration in Zelda for almost a half century. By comparison Fromsoft is only
taking its' first steps- but already the two follow a similar pattern. This brings
very similar success stories of dominating (if not inventing) their respective genres.
It also means Fromsoft is already making the same mistakes.

The word 'soulslike' is tossed around a lot today, and although many competitors 
have since come and gone; "3D Platformer" might as well be 'mariolike'. Nintendo 
dominated the videogame market since the Famicom's debut, they continued to 
ferociously improve the quality of their games to stay on top. By compirson
FromSoftware didn't immediately strike gold, King's Field (1994) was a relative
success but it was no 'Mario' of the RPG genre. Nonetheless, they clearly found 
potential in the game beyond its sales, going on to make 2 immediate sequals, and
lay the groundwork for Dark Souls. FromSoftware would again find hints of oil in 
the ground with Armored Core, using it to keep the engine of their company for 
the next decade.
